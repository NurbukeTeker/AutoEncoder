# AutoEncoder
# Autoencoder with Attention

This is an implementation of an autoencoder with an attention mechanism in `keras` using the `SeqSelfAttention` layer from the `keras-self-attention` library.

## Dependencies

- `keras`
- `keras-self-attention`

## Usage

To use the autoencoder, simply run the `autoencoder.py` file using Python. The autoencoder can be trained on your own dataset by loading the data into the `x_train` and `x_test` variables and modifying the `input_dim` variable to match the shape of your input data.

## Results

The results of the autoencoder with attention can be evaluated using the reconstruction loss and other metrics such as accuracy. The reconstructed outputs can also be visualized to see how well the autoencoder is able to reconstruct the original inputs.

## Conclusion

The addition of an attention mechanism to the autoencoder can help to improve the reconstruction of the input data by allowing the model to focus on the most important features in the encoding.
